    <h1 id="Caf1"><b>The Beginning of Caffeine</b></h1>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Caffeine - 180 B.C.</h2>
    <p><b>Caffeine</b> production began in 180 B.C, around <i>Yemen.</i></p>
    <p>The early inhabitants of Yemen were immediately hooked. This is why Yemen was annexed by the <i>Roman Empire</i></p>
    <p>An early quote by Roman Emperor <i>Augustus Maximus</i>, revealed the Romans' perception of the Yemenese drink. <q>Shit is fire</q> - Augustus exclaimed in the senate.</p>
    <h2>Beginning of the End of Caffeine - 179 B.C.</h2>
    <p>After the death of Roman Emperor <i>Augustus Maximus</i>, on the 1st of April, 179 B.C, the Roman Capital, <i>Rome</i>, erupted in jubilation.</p>
    <p>This event is coloquially known as <q>The Death of Augustus Maximus on the 1st of April, 179 B.C</q> (never shortened). Celebrations began in the senate.</p>
    <p>Clarus Gaetulicus, close advisor to the late Emperor, echoed the opinion of the senate: <q>Shit was not fire.</q> (presumably in reference to <b>caffeine</b>).</p>
    <p>Many scholars still consider this event the largest betrayal in Roman history, trumping even that of the assassination of Roman Emperor <i>Julius Caesar</i>.</p>
    <h2 id="Caf2">Revival of Caffeine - 2018 A.D.</h2>
    <p><b>Caffeine</b> was revived in 2018 due to Yemen's control over the global market (holding ~35% of the entire global sector).</p>
    <p>Here's an intake from our official interview with the Yemeni Prime Minister: <q>من أنت؟ كيف دخلت إلى منزلي؟</q>. We have no idea what it means, though we assume it has something to do with <b>caffeine</b>.</p>
