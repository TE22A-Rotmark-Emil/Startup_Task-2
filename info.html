    <h2>It was funny</h2>
    <p>You might say some stupid stuff like "ooo we literally have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FLRHejWAo8">footage of you mowing down a village</a>". Well, soorryyy that you can't take a joke, buster!</p>
    <p>Humour is entirely subjective. Just because your humour doesn't coincide with my doesn't mean you can jail me for breaching the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.30_GC-I-EN.pdf">Geneva Conventions</a>, even if correct, humour trumps the jurisdiction of the international court of justice.</p>
    <h2>Reconsider</h2>
    <p>I've been an upstanding citizen (barring this specific incident) and I was generally good. Mr. Thomas Pane only had to yell at me four times before I stopped threatening unarmed Israeli civilians with violence. It's absurd for me to sit behind bars while unarmed children run around our streets.</p>
    <p>Think of all my good deeds. In case you forgot, for whatever reason, I have decided to compile a list:</p>
    <ol>I gave money to a grandma</ol>
    <ol>I agreed to consider repaying war reparations to the Yemeni Embassy</ol>
    <ol>Repaired the moon with duct tape after it was split in two</ol>
    <p>In my humble opinion, this obviously trumps my bad deeds, such as when I:</p>
    <ol>Stole money from a grandma</ol>
    <ol>Pocketed the war reparations reserved to the Yemeni Embassy</ol>
    <ol>Split the moon in two</ol>
    <p>If you're reading this, <a href="./autobionguyen.html" target="_blank">Nguyễn Tuấn Ðức</a>, please, bail me out. I'm in solitary confinement at 11.3493° N, 142.1996° E. Please.</p>
