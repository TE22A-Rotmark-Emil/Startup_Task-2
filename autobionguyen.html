    <h1 class="header">Nguyễn Tuấn Ðức</h1>
    <h1 class="occupation">Successful businessman</h1>
    <p>Nguyễn Tuấn Ðức is an entrepreneur. He invented clean water, the washing machine, the year 1864, and the concept of fraud. Nguyen has a long history of standing for the consumer, always milking consumers for every penny they're worth. If you aren't a cheapstake and understand that paying full price fills his pockets more than a discount would, you've come to the right place.</p>
    <p>Nguyen has established his business in all 9(Australia included) continents. Nguyen and his company cannot be held liable for any wrongdoings done on behalf of the consumer. If any consumer wrongdoing is proven (including but not limited to: expoliation of evidence, unboxing any purchased item ever, overthrowing the Libyan government, or breathing) then the right to a refund is revoked.</p>
    <p>Nguyen is not a lawyer. Nguyen has never been a lawyer. Nguyen doesn't even know what a lawyer is. If you're owed $12,368 of legal fees, you must've mixed Nguyen up with an entirely different, distinct, and unrelated figure. All lawsuits filed his way are to be treated as SLAPP lawsuits and will be ignored indefinitely.</p>
    <p>Seeking damages? You have come to the wrong place. Seeking undiscounted prices on low-tier goods? Now we're talking! Nguyen is coloquially known as "The Greatest Entrepreneur in the west", which is especially funny considering he's not in the west and has never lived there. Nguyen and his family have never set foot in Kansas City, Kansas despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.</p>
